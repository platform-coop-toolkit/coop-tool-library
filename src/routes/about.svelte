	<p>The Cooperative Tool Library is a website where people can find software tools for their co-ops, and share the tools they use with other co-ops.</p>

	<h2>Who is the Tool Library for?</h2>

	<h2>Who runs the Tool Library?</h2>
	<p>This website is help run by everyone in the co-op community who can contribute by adding tools, editing their information to ensure accuracy, and those who write reviews. A small amount of moderation is done by the Platform Cooperative Consortium when tools are added. </p>

	<h2>Who created the Tool Library?</h2>
	<p>The Cooperative Tool Library is created as a collaboration between the Inclusive Design Research Centre, our many co-designers from the cooperative community, and the Platform Cooperative Consortium.</p>
